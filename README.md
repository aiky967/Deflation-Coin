# What is the Reflection token?
Reflection tokens allow holders to earn passive returns from transaction fees by simply holding onto their assets.
On every transaction theirs a transaction fee. For the SafeMoon token, it was 10% but now it's going to change to 1%.

# SafeMoon 10% Tokenomics fee on SWaP
- 4.0% Reflections (SAFEMOON)
- 3.0% LP Generation (In BNB/TMI)
- 2.0% Burn (SAFEMOON)
- 1.0% Ecosystem Growth Fund (In BNB/TMI)

Similar to SafeMoon I built a Deflection token. It takes a 2% transaction fee on every transaction.
- 1.0% Reflections (DFL)
- 1.0% Burn (DFL)

# What is the Reflection?
1.0% Reflections means 1.0% of the transaction amount will be distributed among the holders.
